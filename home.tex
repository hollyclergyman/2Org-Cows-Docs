\subsection{home.php}

The home.php page serves as the central page of the whole project, providing basic information on the use of the frontend and showing all navigation entries to refer to other pages 
within the frontend. To ensure that non permissioned users can not access pages such as \hyperref[create-user.php]{create-user.php}, these entries are just shown to users with roles 
higher than 1 or 2. The same happens for the menu, which is included in all pages, to allow easy navigation. 

\subsection{traffic.php}
The traffic page is the evaluation page to the logdb database, which keeps track of users accessing the login.php page and successful logins. As these data are highly sensitive and 
not important for the daily use of the database, the access to this page is limited to users with the role admin (role code 4). The presented data are split into different tables, 
one for the login.php page, displaying amount of accesses, time and IP address. Another table displays the data for the logged in users, showing IP address, time of login and user 
invoked. And finally there is a table displaying all login attempts, which failed due to incorrect credentials. This table should enable the recognition of brute force attacks on 
given accounts.
