\section{Database}

The database for the projects are API-compatible, SQL databases, which run on freely available linux systems. Eventually the used and tested MySQL or MariaDB databases could be 
replaced by other systems, such as MSSQL. Nevertheless, a full compatibility of other databases with the source code provided can not be guaranteed. To ensure safe operation of the
server, databases, which are not directly linked to the project data, are separated from the main database. As a result, the login database and the external logging database are 
separated from the main database. Therefore, three different databases exist for the purpose of the project.\\ 
To increase the security of the database and to limit the risk of damage in case of SQL-injections, all databases are accessed by non-privileged users. Furthermore, there is a 
separation in the users, regarding the function of the database invoked, to limit access to sensitive data in the database.
