\section{Introduction}

The 2Org-Cows project is multinational and multi-partner project of research institutions in organic agriculture in Europe. It aims to improve the breeding of dairy cattle for organic dairy cow keeping
and therefore aims to collect data to measure different parameters of animal welfare, health and keeping.\\
In order to analyze all these data, a huge database has been created, which consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
 \item a webbased, graphical user interface for the final user to access and query the database using a standard webbrowser
 \item a variety of interfaces to other programs
 \item software to analyze database stored datasets using big data methods, mainly based on R and on Python3
 \item MySQL databases as the storage backbone of the whole software and project
 \item Ubuntu 16.04 operating system, PHP7 scripting language and Apache2 webserver to provide the user with the data required
\end{itemize}
In the following all parts of the software for the 2Org-Cows project should be documented. Please note that this file is work in progress and will therefore change steadily.

\section{Common information regarding the coding}
The project is generally based in its programming on several concepts, which should be briefly displayed in the following. The programming is therefore differenciated in the parts 
regarded. 
\paragraph{Web Frontend}
The web frontend is largely written in PHP7 and HTML5, following the following paradigms: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item clear structure of code
 \item clear separation of display code and code for the processing of input
 \item easy to write, understand and maintain code
 \item mostly procedural code style, only exception is the database system, which is based on object oriented code style
\end{itemize}
