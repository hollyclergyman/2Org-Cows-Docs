and therefore aims to collect data to measure different parameters of animal welfare, health and keeping.\\
In order to analyze all these data, a huge database has been created, which consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
 \item a browserbased, graphical user interface for the final user to access and query the database
 \item a variety of interfaces to other programs
 \item software to analyze database stored datasets using big data methods
\end{itemize}
